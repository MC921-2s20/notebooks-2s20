    "Liveness analysis is a data flow analysis that finds what variables are live after any\n",
    "statement. It is an any-path, backward flow analysis. We will perform intra-procedural\n",
    "liveness analysis (i.e., we will compute liveness at the function granularity, but not\n",
    "across functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have built the CFG, liveness analysis is easy. Compute the GEN and KILL sets for\n",
    "each block. GEN represents all the temporaries and variables that are used in an\n",
    "instruction, and KILL represents all the temporaries and variables that are defined in\n",
    "an instruction. For most instructions, this should be pretty straightforward. A few\n",
    "tricky cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - ```store_type``` this instruction use source (GEN) & define target (KILL)\n",
    "  while ```store_type_*```use both source & target. The same for ```read_type``` and\n",
    "   ```read_type_*```. Note that this strategy means that you do not touch the\n",
    "    ```alloc_type``` instructions. An extra pass can be made at final to remove unused\n",
    "     allocs.\n",
    "  - ```call``` instructions require special care. Because we do not analyze liveness\n",
    "  across functions, we must make conservative assumptions about what happens in function\n",
    "  calls. In particular, we GEN all the temporaries in ```param_type```. The ```call```\n",
    "  itself kills the return var. The GEN set for any ```call``` instruction therefore\n",
    "  contains all global variables, while the KILL set is their return var.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you know the GEN and KILL sets for each CFG node, you can compute liveness. To do\n",
    "this, define IN (live-in) and OUT (live-out) sets for each CFG Node. Initialize the OUT\n",
    "sets for Exit nodes to all global variables (because global variables may be used after\n",
    "the function returns), and initialize all other sets to empty. Then compute the live-in\n",
    "and live-out sets for node as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The set of variables that are live out of a node is the union of all the variables\n",
    "  that are live in to the node's successors.\n",
    "  - The set of variables that are live in to a node is the set of variables that are live\n",
    "  out for the node, minus any variables that are killed by the node, plus any variables\n",
    "  that are gen-ed by the node.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Note that these definitions are recursive: the live-out set of a node is defined in\n",
    "terms of the live-in sets of its successors, which are in turn defined in terms of the\n",
    "live-in sets of their successors, and so on. If there is a loop in the code, then the\n",
    "definition seems circular.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trick to computing liveness is to compute a fixpoint: assignments to each of the\n",
    "live-in and live-out sets so that if you try to compute any node's live-in or live-out\n",
    "set again, you will get the same result you already have. To do this, we will use a worklist\n",
    "algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Put all the IR nodes on the worklist\n",
    "  2. Pull an IR node off the worklist, and compute its live-out and live-in sets according\n",
    "   to the definitions above.\n",
    "  3. If the live-in set of the node gets updated by the previous step, put all of the\n",
    "  node's predecessors on the worklist (because they may need to update their live-out sets).\n",
    "  4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the worklist is empty. The live-out sets of each node\n",
