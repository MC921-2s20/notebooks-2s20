    "## Single Static Assignment\n",
    "The first problem is how to decompose complex expressions into\n",
    "something that can be handled more simply.  One way to do this is\n",
    "to decompose all expressions into a sequence of simple assignments\n",
    "involving binary or unary operations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, suppose you had a mathematical expression like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "        2 + 3 * 4 - 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here is one possible way to decompose the expression into simple\n",
    "operations:\n",
    "```\n",
    "        %1 = 2\n",
    "        %2 = 3\n",
    "        %3 = 4\n",
    "        %4 = %2 * %3\n",
    "        %5 = %1 + %4\n",
    "        %6 = 5\n",
    "        %7 = %5 - %6\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this code, the **%n** variables are simply temporaries used while\n",
    "carrying out the calculation.  A critical feature of SSA is that such\n",
    "temporary variables are only assigned once (single assignment) and\n",
    "never reused.  Thus, if you were to evaluate another expression, you\n",
    "would simply keep incrementing the numbers. For example, if you were\n",
    "to evaluate **10 + 20 + 30**, you would have code like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "        %8 = 10\n",
    "        %9 = 20\n",
    "        %10 = %8 + %9\n",
    "        %11 = 30\n",
    "        %12 = %10 + %11\n",
    "```\n",
    "SSA is meant to mimic the low-level instructions one might carry out \n",
    "on a CPU.  Another benefit of SSA is that it is very easy to encode and\n",
    "manipulate using simple data structures such as tuples. For example,\n",
    "you could encode the above sequence of operations as a list like this:\n",
    "\n",

    "### Dealing with Variables\n",
    "In your program, you are probably going to have some variables that get\n",
    "used and assigned different values.  For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "       a = 10 + 20;\n",
    "       b = 2 * a;\n",

    "```\n",
    "In \"pure SSA\", all of your variables would actually be versioned just\n",
    "like temporaries in the expressions above.  For example, you would\n",
    "emit code like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "       %1 = 10\n",
    "       %2 = 20\n",
    "       a_1 = %1 + %2\n",
    "       %4 = 2\n",
    "       b_1 = %4 * a_1\n",
    "       %5 = 1 \n",
    "       a_2 = a_1 + %5\n",
    "       ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "To avoid this, we're going to treat declared variables as memory locations and access\n",
    "them using load/store instructions.  For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "       %1 = 10\n",
    "       %2 = 20\n",
    "       %3 = %1 + %2\n",
